## **Workflow Overview**
The application workflow involves users placing bets, dropping balls into the Plinko game board, and viewing deterministic results calculated by the backend. The server precomputes paths for the balls to follow, ensuring fairness and replicability across all devices.

---

### **Project Structure for Feature Implementation**
This project is structured to ensure a systematic and incremental development process. Each week builds upon the previous deliverables, enabling a smooth transition from basic to advanced functionalities.

**NOTE:** Participants are encouraged to customize the design and functionality to make the application unique.
